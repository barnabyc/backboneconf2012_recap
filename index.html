          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: Separate your concerns. Don't do JS the old way. Get your state out of the DOM! Use Models to actually Model your data! It really is possible to separate your concerns in a browser! ZOMG!</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: BackBone came from DocumentCloud. All open source and highly accessible thanks to minimal size.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Quite. Lots of your favorite sites built with BackBone: Pandora, Rdio, Trello, MetaLab Flow, FourSquare, Khan Academy!</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> We already hold these principles dear. We know this is the future. We're ahead of a lot of the audience.</li>

          <h2>2. Ember.js</h2>
          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: Ember is better than BackBone. (<em>Enemy territory much?</em>)</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: BackBone is <em>too</em> small and you really need a more comprehensive framework to do anything substantial.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Unclear. Some of the features of Ember are appealing, but in terms of keeping a project slim, are likely overkill.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> We looked at Ember's early incarnations, and have kept an eye out, but nothing compelling to make us reconsider our choices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: Civility is key to collaborative endeavors.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: JS is an evolving language, and not everybody agrees on how to write it. If you have strong opinions and little tact, you can easily end-up missing the point.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: It was a good wake-up call to a lot of the attendees as getting more involved in the community means learning how to speak to people.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Most of the time we're all polite and constructive, but even we have our moments of bluntness...</li>

          <h2>4. JS Module Patterns</h2>
          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: Organize your application code for sanity <em>and</em> performance!</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: In addition to how to model your application, don't overlook your file structure. Split code into modules, load them with a require construct, deprecate during refactor.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Somewhat. A lot of folks are really getting into the core concepts of MVC, but overall app structure is still secondary.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Solid footing. Our JS code organization and structure has evolved and we're continuing to improve asset packaging and performance.</li>

          <h2>5. Data Binding</h2>
          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: Seamless 2-way data binding is an ideal of user/data interaction.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: Demonstrated very concisely how easy it is to abstract user model changes automatically reflected in views, and vice-versa (using his AngularJS framework).</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Minimal. It's a fairly advanced topic that is most easily accomplished with a framework that handles both the model and the view logic, so not as simply as just bolting on a templating engine to a BackBone app.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Early stages. We've had this need before, and done a good job at implementing it, but nothing as seamless and transparent as AngularJS provides.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>6. BackBone from a Dojo-er</h2>
          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;&#10025;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: View handling in BackBone is a little lacking.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: Dojo is another JS framework. Rebecca hasn't used BackBone much. She explained how she found herself writing some view handling code that she wouldn't have had to in Dojo.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Unclear. Jeremy's take away (as noted by almost all speakers and participants) was to add some helper methods for view destroying and event unbinding.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Solid footing. We started well and continue to improve our event management within long-lived models to short-lived view scenarios.</li>

          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: BackBone is slim on purpose, here's some extra modules and advice to help.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: Additional modules plus a lot of suggested patterns to improve maintainability.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Growing. A lot of the attendees were interested and asked detailed questions about models, data types, templating, etc.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Ahead of the curve. We've taken good advantage of YUI modules and patterns, and written many abstractions ourselves. If we were using BackBone, undoubtedly Lumbar would be in our repo but we've still be using a lot of the same patterns.</li>

          <h2>8. Migrating a Large App to BackBone</h2>
          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: NewsBlur is much more maintainable and performant since migrating.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: Long, winding examples highlighting very fragile linkages when truth is held in DOM elements. Ultimately proving that porting a large application is possible. (War stories always reassuring.)</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Strong. The attendees were all basically in the camp that MVC is better than DOM, but it was reassuring to hear.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Ahead of the curve. We've already learned from the trials of complex, inter-dependent DOM spaghetti; bless our MVC saviors!</li>

          <h3>&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10029;&#10025;</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: Robust app structure will make data updates inconsequential to manage.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: There is no perfect real-time solution, but thanks to sound data modeling and a solid MVC approach, you shouldn't need to worry that your data may or may not be "real-time".</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Minimal. It's a somewhat niche requirement, and every application is different, but it was well-received to hear Henrik's war stories.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Good understanding. We've tried some real-time (remember Pusher guys?) but haven't had the need to apply real-time data to our revent MVC JS.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><span class="label">Emphasized</span>: War story about building AirBNB's mobile web experience from ground up with BackBone</li>
            <li><span class="label">Detail</span>: Very short deadline, never used BackBone before, didn't really have a clear vision defined - still got it done in time.</li>
            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Strong. Very compelling tale and reassuring to hear from a tangible brand. Also great to see their mobile architecture is not simplistic and handle some fairly complex abstractions such as Caching and Analytics.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Our mobile web experience is lacking. But not from lack of ideas!</li>

            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Minimal. YUI simply doesn't have the exposure of BackBone, but not through lack of awesome! We still have intentions to open source a bunch of our code and make our name readily associated with YUI.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Where are we?</span> Cutting edge. We're already using Y.App and are very gratified to have been able to discuss some future ideas with Eric.</li>

            <li><span class="label">Popularity</span>: Minimal. These really are areas without a great deal of sexy adoption right now, but they're evolving.</li>
